I'm Gautham, a developer who loves building meaningful and practical solutions.

I enjoy working on AI, automation, and modern web applications.
If an idea excites me, I’ll build it, refine it, and ship it.

My main stack includes Python, Java, Flask, HTML/CSS, and tools like VS Code, Git, and SQLite.

I’m currently working on a bunch of cool projects — including AI agents, recommendation systems, and campus-utility platforms.

If you’d like to connect or collaborate, feel free to reach out!
